# Picture-Identifier-
Anthony Krenek's code 

This is a Python program that is foucsed on finding the nearest neighbor for images that are related 
I use a lot of different Linear Algebra techniques to be able to closley identify the images 
Such as: 
Finding Eigenfaces, Eigenvectors, Relative Norm and other built in NumPy funtions 
Also: A low level K Nearest Neighbor is used at the end to iterate over all of the images to closly identify which person fits with the picture

This a python project using Numpy and Linear Algebra techniques to find closely related faces from a large data set.

The zip file is too large to upload to GitHub of the faces.
**Libraries** 

Matplot

Numpy 


**Linear Algebra Techniques**

EigenVectors 

EigenValues

EigenFaces

Singular Value Decomposition 

Distance Formulas 

Row and Column Vectors 


**Structure**
Using different distance formulas such as z_bar,eigenfaces and np.linalg.norm


To find the closely related faces I itreated over each test image (tst_img1,test_img2,test_img3)


The implementation worked and I was succesfully able to get the closly related faces
